# Super-Resolution-of-Level-17-Images-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
Abstract The generative adversarial networks (GAN) deep learning models are being widely used in the field of image processing and its applications such as image generation, feature extraction, image recovery and image super-resolution to name a few. Image super-resolution has a board range of applications like satellite and aerial image analysis, medical image processing, compressed image/video enhancement, etc. This work implements an image super-resolution using generative adversarial network for super-resolution of level-17 low-resolution geospatial images obtained from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) imagery. The results show that the generated super-resolution image can recuperate photo-realistic textures from low-resolution input pictures. The performance of the model is evaluated with qualitative measure indices such as structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The performance metric demonstrates that the model can generate images as close to that of the high-resolution image and it also has finer details.
